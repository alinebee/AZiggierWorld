The tests in fixture_tests require game files from the original DOS release of Another World.
These are copyrighted and so are not legal to distribute as part of this project,
but they are fairly easy to find on the internet.

Once you've found a version of the game, copy the following files into this folder:
BANK01
BANK02
BANK03
BANK04
BANK05
BANK06
BANK07
BANK08
BANK09
BANK0A
BANK0B
BANK0C
BANK0D
MEMLIST.BIN

On case-sensitive filesystems, you will need to ensure that all filenames are uppercase.
